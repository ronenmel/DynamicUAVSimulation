**Introduction**
This guide outlines the steps required to run the project, which consists of both a C++ component and a Python component. 
The C++ component generates data files used by the Python component to produce graphical outputs.

**Prerequisites**
- C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Python interpreter installed (Python 3.x recommended)
- Required libraries installed for Python (e.g., Matplotlib)

**Steps to Run the Project**
Compile and Run the C++ Component
1. Navigate to the DynamicUAVSimulation file.
2. Compile the C++ code by running the solution file `DynamicUAVSimulation.sln`.
3. Ensure that the C++ component runs successfully and generates the necessary output files.

**Execute the Python Component**
1. Navigate to the directory containing the Python source file (DynamicUAVSimulation\DynamicUAVSimulation).
2. Run the `drawGraphOfUav's.py` script responsible for processing the output files generated by the C++ component and producing graphical outputs.
3. Ensure that the Python component executes without errors and generates the desired graphical outputs.

**Viewing the Results**
- After running both the C++ and Python components, you can view the results produced by the Python script.
- The graphical outputs (plots, graphs) generated by the Python script should now be visible either on-screen or saved in the specified location.
